# Galio Framework official website
Galio's official website is open source and a tool for and by the community. Submit isseus and pull requests for site ideas or copy edits.

## Under the Hood

The site is made with Jekyll, an open source static site generator. This means Jekyll takes the content we want te be on the site and turns them into HTML files automatically. GitHub provides free hosting for repositories, called GitHub pages, and that's how the site is hosted.

## Contributing

If you see an error or a place where content should be updated or improved, just fork this repository to your account, make the change you'd like and then submit a pull request. If you're not able to make the change, file an [issue](https://github.com/galio-org/galio-org.github.io/issues/new).
